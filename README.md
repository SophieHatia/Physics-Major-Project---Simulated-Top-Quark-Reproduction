# Physics-Major-Project---Simulated-Top-Quark-Reproduction

Conducted a Major Research project, reconstructing the top quark from simulated top - anti top quark interactions and comparing the reconstructed top quark mass to the original simulated top quark mass by combining interaction products and comparing the various distribution graphs and histograms produced to the expected distributions and making judgements about error margins to decide whether the combinations were correct. Coded using C++ within a linux terminal.
